# Algorithms
This project is for implementing the algorithms that are taught in this [Algorithms Illuminated: Part 1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999282905) book and [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer) course.
## Chapter 1
Here is a list of the algorithms that are implemented in this chapter:
- Karatsuba Multiplication
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Randomized Selection
- Deterministic Selection
- Karger's algorithm
- Inversion Count
- Closest Pair of Points (Finding the closest distance between points in an array)
