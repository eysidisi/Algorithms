# Algorithms
This project is for implementing the algorithms that are taught in these books:


- [Algorithms Illuminated: Part 1: The Basics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999282905) 
- [Algorithms Illuminated Part 2: Graph Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com.tr/Algorithms-Illuminated-Part-Structures-Roughgarden/dp/0999282921) 
- [Algorithms Illuminated Part 3: Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Illuminated-Part-Dynamic-Programming/dp/0999282948) 

and in these courses:
- [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer)
- [Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures)
- [Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-greedy)
