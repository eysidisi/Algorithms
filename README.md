# Algorithms
This project is for implementing the algorithms that are taught in this [Algorithms Illuminated: Part 1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999282905) book and [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer) course. Here is a list of the algorithms and data structures that are implemented in each chapter:
## Part 1
- Karatsuba Multiplication
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Randomized Selection
- Deterministic Selection
- Karger's algorithm
- Inversion Count
- Closest Pair of Points (Finding the closest distance between points in an array)

## Part 2
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Tarjan's Algorithm
- Depth/Breadth First Travel of Graphs

## Part 3
- Knapsack Problem Solution Algorithm
- Calculating Maximum Weighted Independent Set
- Calculating Minimum Spanning Tree
- Huffman Algorithm
- Kruskal's MST Algorithm
